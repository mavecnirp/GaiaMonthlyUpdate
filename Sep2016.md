#### Highlight

* High risk on completion of 2016 roadmap projects due to lack of resource. 
* Ops team takes over many regular maintenance, review and survey tasks from UK team. In the same time, project related tasks are always first priority.

#### Achieved

###### 2016 Roadmap:

* Vulnerability Review Action
    * DeepSecurity Policy tuning (Charles & Jeffery Testing)
    	- Testing and deploy DeepSecurity behind NAT gateway for avoid the limitation of DeepSecurity Agent
    	- Planning to test on CentOS and Windows environments
    	- Leverage Trend Micro DeepSecurity as service on consumer projects on AWS
    * Service/Infra Improvement and Stablization.        
    * Container Management. (Kevin, Derek Deploy and Demo)
        ###### Event and Tasks:
* Review and finish the configuration for the EBS backup plan for Consumer Trendops instances.
* Discuss with DCS about network unstable between AWS and DCS. This issue was happening on most of consumer services.
* Perform monthly system patch for TrendOps machines.
* Find out the unexpected data transfer from InfoSec’s account
